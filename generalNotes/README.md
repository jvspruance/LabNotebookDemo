# generalNotes

These notes are much less formal than those in the associated project folders. This space is reserved for idea generation/brainstorming, cool papers, planning out what to discuss with my PI and any feedback I get from them or others, etc.

Some of the information in here may duplicate things discussed in the experimental notes page, and that is fine (maybe even good?)

Pieces of notes will be organized in folders related to general things I am working on. The first folder I made is titled with the date and `gettingStarted`. I'm using this space to document how I'm getting this lab notebook set up and how I will begin my research... the vision is that these directories will evolve over time and I will have many collections of folders rather than ~hundreds of notes all piled into the same directory.
